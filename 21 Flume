// flume user docs: http://archive-primary.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/flume-ng-1.6.0-cdh5.10.1/FlumeUserGuide.html
create new dir, create a new example.conf file and paste the below

# this is a simple example to show how to use flume, don't use this on production environment

# example.conf: A single-node Flume configuration

# Name the components on this agent
a1.sources = r1
a1.sinks = k1
a1.channels = c1

# Describe/configure the source
a1.sources.r1.type = netcat
a1.sources.r1.bind = localhost
a1.sources.r1.port = 44444

# Describe the sink
a1.sinks.k1.type = logger

# Use a channel which buffers events in memory
a1.channels.c1.type = memory
a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100

# Bind the source and sink to the channel
a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1

##### where: a1 is the agent name, it can be anything 
##### sources is the data source that flume agent will read the data from
##### sinks is the sink that will write to the destination
##### channels is the communication between the source and the sink

# to start flume agent, in the terminal type
$ bin/flume-ng agent -n $agent_name -c conf -f conf/flume-conf.properties.template
# where $agent_name is the agent name tha you've defined in the .conf file, in our case it's a1
flume-ng agent --name a1 --conf-file /home/cloudera/Downloads/flume_demo/example.conf
